In Bis3dOv:

    LL: int
        use: number of Lagrange interpolation node used during near evaluation
        option: -LL

    patch_partition: vector<int> of size number of patches
        use: indicate which MPI group the ith patch is a member of, i.e.
             patch_partition[i] = k for k = 0, ... , mpi_rank.
        option: initialized prior to Bis3dOvGeneric instantiation and setup.

    dom: 0/1
        use: Indicate whether the domain of interest is bounded or unbounded
             0 - bounded domain
             1 - unbounded domain
        option: -dom

    bdtype: 0/1
        use: Indicate the domain representation scheme
             0 - indicates domain is represented analytically
             1 - indicates domain is represented via blended patches.
        option: -bdtype
        

    eqcoefs: vector<double>
        use: 
        option: initialized prior to Bis3dOvGeneric instantiation and setup.

    spacing: double <= .2 and >= .025
        use:
        option: -bis3d_spacing

    refined_spacing: double <= .2 and >= .0125
        use: 
        option: -bis3d_rfdspacing

    rootlvl: integer: -1 (or -2 in odd cases)
        use: needed by  old KIFMM local essential tree implementation.
             set in the options file
        option: -bis3d_rootlvl

In Be3dOvNea:

In Be3dOvRon:

    radmult: integer > 2 
        use:  floating POU function is set to step_size*radmult, in be3dovron.cpp
            stored in  Be3dOvRon, 
            set when the Be3dOvRon object is created in Bis3dOvGeneric
            computed by  radmult_spacing function defined  in common/ebi_uti, as an
            explicit map from step_size values
        option: -bis3d_re_radmult, but its value is ignored (call commented out in
        setFromOptions)
