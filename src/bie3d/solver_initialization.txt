Intialization sequence for  solver data

1. create DN3dOv (maintains distributed storage for per sample point quantitities sample_point_*)
  
2. DN3dOv->setup() initializes per-patch data local to each partition, and distributed  sample_point_* Vecs

3. create solver object, e.g. Bis3dLapDr

4. Solver setup creates matvec object for evaluation on the surface Be3dOvRon.

5. Be3dOvRon has handles  _trgpos and _trgbpt which are initialized from the corresponding
sample_point Vecs. 

6. Be3dOvRon setup
  --  initializes non-distributed _srcPos, _srcNor, _trgPos stored in the base class Be3dOv,
  which are used to initialize FMM.

  -- calls setuptdata from the base class Be3dOv to initialize a TData structure stored in Be3dOvRon, which contains Vecs colbpt, colpos (collocation point data)

7. Be3dOv->setuptdata calls DN3dOv->tctran to initialize non-distibuted c2tmap, colnumvec, colbegvec, stored in TData, which are needed to initialize colbpt and colpos
